# Multi-cluster Job Workload Management with Kueue and KubeStellar
This project aims to simplify the deployment and management of batch workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters using [Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io) for job queueing and [KubeStellar](https://docs.kubestellar.io) for multi-cluster configuration management.


## Overview
This repository contains two core controllers:

- *WorkloadController:* watches for Kueue `Workload` objects and orchestrates the downsync and deployment of corresponding jobs to worker clusters managed by KubeStellar
- *QuotaManagerController:* monitors [ClusterMetrics](https://github.com/kubestellar/galaxy/tree/main/clustermetrics) from each worker cluster and dynamically updates Kueue's global resource quotas as needed

## Description
In multi-cluster Kubernetes environments, managing batch workloads and ensuring efficient resource utilization across clusters can be a complex challenge. Organizations often face issues such as resource contention, over-provisioning, and inefficient workload distribution, leading to suboptimal resource utilization and increased costs.

The kueue-ks project goal is to address these challenges by leveraging Kueue's quota management capabilities and integrating with KubeStellar for multi-cluster configuration management. The primary goal is to enable centralized management and intelligent distribution of batch workloads across multiple clusters based on available resource quotas.


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [K3D](https://k3d.io) to get a local cluster for testing.

### Running on the K3D cluster
1. Check out this [instructions](./scripts/kueue/)

2. Run job examples:

```sh
kubectl create -f examples/batch-job.yaml
```

```sh
kubectl create -f examples/pytorch-simple-job.yaml
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
